## Objective

This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying brain tumor images to support early diagnosis and treatment planning. I developed this project individually, focusing on deep learning techniques for image classification. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify medical imaging data into tumor and non-tumor categories, providing a streamlined, efficient diagnostic tool for healthcare applications.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in Python programming and working with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.
- In-depth understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.
- Data preprocessing techniques, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Experience in model training, validation, and testing for medical imaging data.
- Knowledge of hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- Improved analytical skills for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Ability to troubleshoot and debug complex deep learning models.
- Enhanced understanding of the ethical considerations in handling and processing medical data.

## Steps and Some Preview

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The model begins by loading and preprocessing MRI brain scans. Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model generalization.
